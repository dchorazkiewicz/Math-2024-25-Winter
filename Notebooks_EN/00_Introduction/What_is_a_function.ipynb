    "# Function Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "**Set-theoretic definition of a function** states that a function $f$ is a special case of a relation. A relation is simply any set of ordered pairs. A function, on the other hand, is a relation $f \\subseteq X \\times Y$ that satisfies an additional condition: for each element $x \\in X$, there is **exactly one** element $y \\in Y$ assigned to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, a function $f$ is a relation that satisfies the following condition:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\forall x_1, x_2 \\in X, \\, \\forall y_1, y_2 \\in Y \\, \\left( (x_1, y_1) \\in f \\land (x_2, y_2) \\in f : (x_1 = x_2) \\Rightarrow (y_1 = y_2) \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that if for the same $x_1$ we have two pairs $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_1, y_2)$, then $y_1$ must be equal to $y_2$. In other words, no element from $X$ can be associated with more than one element from $Y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Points:\n",
    "1. **Relation** in set theory is simply a set of ordered pairs $(x, y)$, where $x$ comes from set $X$ and $y$ comes from set $Y$.\n",
    "2. **Function** is a relation that additionally satisfies the condition that for every $x$ there is exactly one pair $(x, y)$ in this relation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, a function $f \\subseteq X \\times Y$ is a relation that satisfies the additional condition that for each $x \\in X$ there is exactly one $y \\in Y$ such that $(x, y) \\in f$.\n",
